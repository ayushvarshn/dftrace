# dftrace

Trace and explain how your pandas DataFrame changes over time.

## Why dftrace?

Pandas makes it easy to transform data — and very hard to understand *what just happened*.

Questions like:
- Why did these rows disappear?
- Where did these NaNs come from?
- When did this column change type?

Pandas gives no answers.

`dftrace` adds lightweight, opt-in observability to DataFrame transformations.
